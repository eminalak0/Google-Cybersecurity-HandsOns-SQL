# Filter with AND, OR, and NOT

In this lab, I practiced combining multiple conditions in SQL queries using logical operators like `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`. These filters are essential for narrowing down specific datasets during security analysis.

## Tasks Completed

- Filtered login attempts that occurred outside regular working hours  
- Filtered login attempts on specific dates  
- Filtered login attempts originating from particular locations  
- Retrieved employee information for specific departments  
- Retrieved employee information excluding certain departments  

## Skills Gained

- Writing complex SQL queries with multiple conditions  
- Using `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to combine filters  
- Enhancing query precision for more targeted data retrieval  
- Strengthened data analysis capabilities important for cybersecurity investigations

This lab improved my ability to craft detailed and efficient SQL queries for real-world security data scenarios.
