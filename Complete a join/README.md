# Complete a Join

In this lab, I practiced using different types of SQL joins — INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN — to combine data from multiple tables. Understanding joins is crucial for analyzing relationships in complex databases, especially when investigating security events across systems.

## Tasks Completed

- Used INNER JOIN to link employees with their assigned machines  
- Used LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN to find employees and their machines, including unmatched records  
- Used INNER JOIN to correlate employees with their login attempts  

## Skills Gained

- Understanding and applying INNER, LEFT, and RIGHT JOINs  
- Combining related data from different tables for comprehensive analysis  
- Interpreting join results to identify matched and unmatched records  
- Strengthened ability to query multi-table databases common in cybersecurity data investigations

This lab enhanced my ability to write complex queries joining multiple data sources to uncover critical insights.
