# Filter a SQL Query

In this lab, I practiced filtering data in SQL queries to retrieve specific information from database tables. This is an important skill for cybersecurity analysts who need to focus on relevant data during investigations or audits.

## Tasks Completed

- Retrieved information about machines and their operating systems  
- Filtered records to show only machines with a specific operating system  
- Filtered employees by department  
- Filtered employees based on the machines they use

## Skills Gained

- Using the `WHERE` clause to filter query results  
- Combining multiple filter conditions  
- Targeting specific datasets to streamline data analysis  
- Enhanced ability to query databases for precise security-related information

This lab improved my SQL querying skills to efficiently extract targeted data needed in cybersecurity roles.
