# Apply More Filters in SQL

In this lab, I practiced using advanced filtering techniques in SQL queries to extract specific information based on dates, times, and IDs. These skills are critical for analyzing logs and security events stored in databases.

## Tasks Completed

- Filtered login attempts occurring after a specific date  
- Filtered login attempts within a defined date range  
- Filtered login attempts based on specific times  
- Filtered login attempts by user or event ID  

## Skills Gained

- Using comparison operators with date and time fields  
- Writing queries with `BETWEEN` for date ranges  
- Filtering data precisely to support detailed security investigations  
- Strengthened ability to analyze event logs using SQL  

This lab enhanced my capability to write targeted queries needed in cybersecurity data analysis.
